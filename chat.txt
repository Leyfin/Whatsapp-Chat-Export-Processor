23/06/2021, 10:35 pm - Finley Whittington: I should probably learn git, been putting it off for a while

23/06/2021, 10:37 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: But guis help
23/06/2021, 10:37 pm - Finley Whittington: ye
23/06/2021, 10:37 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: And there's only really like 3 commands to remember really
23/06/2021, 10:37 pm - Finley Whittington: also need to learn vim
23/06/2021, 10:37 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: You can actually get a whole ide in your browser: gitpod.io

code now works with commands that have arguments :D
27/06/2021, 9:58 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: 👍 (i'd put ```msg.content.substr(1)``` into a nicely named variable...)
27/06/2021, 9:58 pm - Finley Whittington: ooh yes, it is a bit lengthy
27/06/2021, 9:59 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: and also, future you will have to lookup ```substr``` again 😉
27/06/2021, 9:59 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: ```everything_but_the_first_character = ...``` 🤔
27/06/2021, 10:00 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: oh, because your command character is `!`, that's what you want to remove...
27/06/2021, 10:01 pm - Finley Whittington: ye
27/06/2021, 10:02 pm - Finley Whittington: hehe
27/06/2021, 10:03 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: you're also still passing ```msg``` to the command functions... 🤔
27/06/2021, 10:05 pm - Finley Whittington: yes, cuz since my commands are in a separate js file, I need to pass ```msg``` so I can use it in them don't I?
27/06/2021, 10:06 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: but what about all your substr work?
27/06/2021, 10:06 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: you'll have to remove the first character again in the commands otherwise?
27/06/2021, 10:10 pm - Finley Whittington: IMG-20210627-WA0035.jpg (file attached)
nope, I export the command that's in the seperate js file as a function, then put it in an object with the keyword assigned to that function
27/06/2021, 10:10 pm - Finley Whittington: IMG-20210627-WA0037.jpg (file attached)
then I've also got this js file that's just a collection of almt he different commands
27/06/2021, 10:11 pm - Finley Whittington: IMG-20210627-WA0033.jpg (file attached)
I should also prolly move all of this stuff into a function in th commands js file too, but I'll do that tmrw
27/06/2021, 10:13 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: ```command(client, msg)``` ⏩ ```command(client, arguments)``` is what i'm saying
27/06/2021, 10:13 pm - Finley Whittington: ohhh
27/06/2021, 10:13 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: your _actual_ command functions are still getting passed the original ```msg``` object
27/06/2021, 10:14 pm - Finley Whittington: I get it now

16/07/2021, 2:35 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: I have some python code somewhere, if that's helpful...
16/07/2021, 2:35 pm - Finley Whittington: yes pls
16/07/2021, 2:35 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: or if you can show me the code, I can be more helpful

This is all I've got so far, it turns it into an array by splitting on each new line, the only problem is that if you attached media to your message then the message gets split into two, so either I need to find a way around that, or it just won't count emojis that were sent with an image
16/07/2021, 2:40 pm - Finley Whittington: I could also do a for loop and just run through each message in the array and count the emojis, but then that would just return the amount of emojis, not the amount each person sent
16/07/2021, 2:43 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: if you do 👆then you'd need to keep track of emoji's per person in another variable
16/07/2021, 2:44 pm - Finley Whittington: yeah but I have no idea how I would do that
16/07/2021, 2:53 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array
16/07/2021, 2:55 pm - Finley Whittington: Oh, that's just a javascript object
16/07/2021, 2:56 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: yup, the key can be the person's name and the value can be an array that you add to?
16/07/2021, 2:58 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: code on a different computer, i'll make you a gist later...
16/07/2021, 2:58 pm - Finley Whittington: Hoke
16/07/2021, 2:58 pm - Finley Whittington: gonna try and do this
16/07/2021, 3:01 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: 👍
16/07/2021, 3:01 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: i think i remember that the trick was that the second line doesn't start with a timestamp?
16/07/2021, 3:04 pm - Finley Whittington: yeah, but then it also doesn't have the name attached either, and idk how to attach it back on
16/07/2021, 3:06 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: yeah, so you either need to look forward one entry
16/07/2021, 3:06 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: or back one
16/07/2021, 3:07 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: i guess you'd always attach it to the last name you've seen?
16/07/2021, 3:07 pm - Finley Whittington: Yeah
16/07/2021, 6:51 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: 🤔 wondering if i should share my code now...
16/07/2021, 6:51 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: feels like cheating...
16/07/2021, 6:51 pm - Finley Whittington: hehe
16/07/2021, 6:52 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: get anything working?
16/07/2021, 6:52 pm - Finley Whittington: Not really, although I'm taking a break for today
16/07/2021, 6:52 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: i think i got around this by doing an export _without_ media...
16/07/2021, 6:52 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: 👍
16/07/2021, 6:55 pm - Finley Whittington: Yeah I tried that, but then it also omits the emojis sent with the media :/
20/07/2021, 9:05 pm - Finley Whittington: woohoo! I finally managed to put all messages into arrays including ones sent with media!!
20/07/2021, 9:07 pm - Finley Whittington: You deleted this message
20/07/2021, 9:07 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: yeah boi!! arrays in arrays in objects ftw!
20/07/2021, 9:07 pm - Finley Whittington: Now all I need to do is add a way to count emojis, and improve the way I check if theres a name in the message
20/07/2021, 9:08 pm - Finley Whittington: Because currently if someone sent a message with the other persons name in it and it was with an image, then it would be put in the wrong array
20/07/2021, 9:08 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: what about if you @ mention someone?
20/07/2021, 9:09 pm - Finley Whittington: oh yeah, although the fix I had in mind should also cover that
20/07/2021, 9:09 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: what do replies look like 🤔
20/07/2021, 9:09 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: 👍
20/07/2021, 9:10 pm - Finley Whittington: Replies don't seem to register, same with stickers
20/07/2021, 9:11 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: iiiiinteresting...
20/07/2021, 9:11 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: i guess we'd have to get at the actual whatsapp database to get that info...
20/07/2021, 9:11 pm - Finley Whittington: ye
20/07/2021, 9:11 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: (but i guess it's cool, because that simplifies things...)

27/07/2021, 2:28 pm - Finley Whittington: got it working sort of!
27/07/2021, 2:29 pm - Finley Whittington: Turns out that emojis and characters that seem like 1 character but are technically more, are called grapheme clusters, and there's a node module for counting them
27/07/2021, 2:34 pm - Finley Whittington: Now my only problem is actually getting the emojis out of a string, and I can either type out every single emoji in a regex, and say replace everything except those, or I'd have to write out most unicode characters(because of stuff like Z̷͚͑̕A̶̦̟̰̯̱̼͎̓͂ͅḼ̷͌G̴̦̝̗͖͇̒͗̄̑͘O̴̞̝̠̎̆̽͑͗͝, which comes up in conversations more than you'd think)
27/07/2021, 2:34 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: 👍🧠 it's kind of a cool rabbit hole- emojiland...
27/07/2021, 2:35 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: pretty sure I found an emoji detecting regex...
27/07/2021, 2:35 pm - Finley Whittington: hmm, I'll look into it
27/07/2021, 2:50 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: i think the trick was to exclude normal characters and punctuation
27/07/2021, 2:51 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: then you're left with emoji...
27/07/2021, 2:52 pm - Finley Whittington: Yeah but then that doesn't exclude weird unicode characters
27/07/2021, 3:01 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: you can just add more exclusions to the list?
27/07/2021, 3:01 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: less things to list than all the emojis?
27/07/2021, 3:01 pm - Finley Whittington: Yeah, but I don't know what those  exclusions would be
27/07/2021, 3:02 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: you run it, see what's wrong, add exclusions and repeat?
27/07/2021, 3:02 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: (the npm module _should_ have a list of all the emojis?)
27/07/2021, 3:04 pm - Finley Whittington: IMG-20210727-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
yeah, but it's not just for emojis, it's every single grapheme cluster
27/07/2021, 3:05 pm - Finley Whittington: that's only about a quarter of the list
27/07/2021, 3:23 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: 🤔 why is that a problem?
27/07/2021, 3:23 pm - Mikal Jayskoos: in general, my advice is try it, don't convince yourself that it won't work...
